 <span style="color: #23A0CE">AllCourse</span> is a new K-12 educational marketplace for traditional, <span style="text-decoration: underline">for-credit</span> courses — taught online. Teachers create profiles detailing their professional experience, and post listings of courses they’re planning to teach. Admins can buy just one seat in a given course, or every seat. AllCourse helps teachers earn more income, and helps schools hire online teachers quickly while also allowing them to offer a vast course catalog for students.
