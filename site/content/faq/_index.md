   questions:
   - question: What is AllCourse and how does it work?
     answer:
     - AllCourse is a marketplace linking schools with credentialed teachers offering for-credit courses. Schools using AllCourse can reduce staffing pressures while significantly increasing their course catalog.
     - Teachers create profiles detailing their professional experience. Teachers can also create listings of courses they’re going to teach.
     - Teacher profiles and courses are easy for school administrators to browse or search. Admins can offer online teaching positions to teachers they connect with. Schools can buy one seat, the entire class, or anything in between. AllCourse manages the matching, the messaging, and the financial transaction.
   - question: Do teachers have to be licensed to teach through AllCourse?
     answer:
     - Not necessarily. Private and charter school teachers often don't have licenses to teach in public schools. AllCourse is open to all qualified teachers, including private and charter school teachers.
     - Teachers who don't provide a license number will not show up in search results for public schools. They may still show up in search results for private or charter schools.
     - Public school teachers should add their license number to their profile, to ensure that they show up in searches for online teaching opportunities with public schools.
   - question: What is the main idea behind AllCourse?
     answer:
     - There is currently a teacher shortage in many parts of the U.S., making it harder to staff schools, which is tough for administrators and bad for students. It also creates additional work and stresses for teachers, who are asked to do ever more.
     - AllCourse makes it much easier to match great teachers with schools. Teachers can earn extra money (they deserve it). And admins can solve their staffing problems and offer students and parents a much larger course catalog.
   - question: Is AllCourse a place for admins to buy individual seats in online courses, or a place to hire teachers who will teach online classes just for their school?
     answer:
     - Schools can do either or both.
     - If admins need someone to teach an entire section, they can search profiles for a teacher who best meets their particular needs and work with that teacher to schedule a course specifically for their school. The teacher will create a customized course listing and the admin will buy all of the seats.
     - In many cases, schools won’t require every seat in a particular course. But they might want to buy a few seats in order to satisfy interested students and parents. Using AllCourse, schools can offer online courses in just about every subject, or with a particular pedagogical focus such as micro class size or remedial/advanced material. When buying just a small number of seats in a course, there will likely be students from other schools participating.
   - question: Is AllCourse an accredited institution?
     answer:
     - No. AllCourse is not a school. AllCourse is a marketplace. We offer a service linking schools and credentialed teachers offering for-credit courses.
   - question: How does course accreditation work?
     answer:
     - In their profiles, teachers list all the places where they are licensed to teach. If a course is not currently approved for credit in a given region, the administrator purchasing it will have to gain approval to give it credit. Admins can often avoid this problem by choosing teachers who have previously taught that course in their state/district — chances are it’s already approved for credit.
   - question: What type of technology do I need to use AllCourse?
     answer:
     - AllCourse works on all major web browsers.
   - question: What format do the classes take?
     answer:
     - Classes are online. Teachers choose the video platform they're most comfortable delivering classes in (e.g., Zoom, Google Hangout, RingCentral) and let students know when to log in. Teachers also inform students what homework materials or classroom management tools (e.g., Google Classroom) will be used.
   - question: How can I contact customer support?
     answer:
     - Email support@allcourse.com
 - heading: For Teachers
   questions:
   - question: What does AllCourse offer teachers?
     answer:
     - On AllCourse, teachers create a profile that can be discovered by administrators who want to offer you work. It’s often hard for school admins to find qualified teachers in their area (especially now due to the ongoing teacher shortage). If admins are willing to have the teacher be online, they can hire YOU on AllCourse.
     - You can also list courses you’re committing to teaching, and set your rate of compensation. Students from around your state or around the U.S. can join your course, after their schools (or their parents) purchase a seat.
   - question: Can anyone teach through AllCourse?
     answer:
     - No. To teach on AllCourse, teachers MUST be qualified to teach semester-long, for-credit courses in schools. Public school, private, or charter school teachers are all welcome to teach. Teachers who don't have a public school teaching license (e.g. private or charter school teachers) must demonstrate their qualifications in their teacher profile, and will only appear in search results for private or charter schools. Public school teachers must list their license number in their profile, and it must be current and in good standing. AllCourse does background checks on teachers and will suspend accounts that don't meet AllCourse standards.
     - AllCourse is a place for schools, students, and parents to find exceptional online teachers offering a variety of subject matters that can be accepted for credit in traditional schools. Only qualified and credentialed teachers with prior teaching experience can list their services on AllCourse.
   - question: How do I earn income using AllCourse?
     answer:
     - 1. You can create a profile and wait for school admins to contact you about teaching online courses for them.
     - 2. You can list courses that you’re planning to teach. They will be discoverable by any school admins who may need a course like yours for their students. You can let your friends and colleagues know about your courses and market your courses on social media. Do you teach a course particularly well? Do you teach a subject that’s in-demand or hard to find? Then list a course and let people know about it.
     - The advantage of listing courses that you'll teach is that you don't have to wait for a school that needs to hire an online teacher to contact you. Your course listings could fill up quickly because they're open to students from multiple schools — especially if you teach something unusual or desirable, or teach your course with a particular style or pedagogy that will appeal to certain kinds of admins or parents.
     - Either way, you will be paid a per-seat rate for every student in your courses. The per-seat rate is set by you before the course starts.
   - question: How much can I earn?
     answer:
     - That depends on you. While other online teaching opportunities often pay just $7-15/hour, on AllCourse you should expect to make something close to your full hourly salary or more. You’re teaching the same courses you’ve been developing throughout your career. There’s no reason you should make less just because you’re teaching them online.
     - As you’d expect, the more courses you teach, and the more students you teach, the more you will make. If your courses prove to be popular, you will be able to increase your per-seat rate, or increase your class size, either of which will increase your compensation. (Of course, you may want to limit class sizes in order to attract more buyers or to offer your students more personal attention.)
   - question: When are teachers paid?
     answer:
     - Teachers are paid twice: halfway through the course and then again once the full course has been delivered.
   - question: Why does AllCourse use a per-seat payment model rather than an hourly salary?
     answer:
     - Some purchasers will only want one seat in a given course. Some will want several. Some will want the entire section. Purchases won’t want to pay a teacher’s full hourly salary if they’re only buying one seat, especially since there will be other purchasers buying seats in that same course. The only way to make payment fair for purchasers is to use a per-seat model.
   - question: How can I set my per-seat rate so that it approximates my hourly salary?
     answer:
     - Teachers can set a per-seat rate based on how many students they think will enroll and how many hours they expect to work.
     - Example: Let’s say you want to make the equivalent of $32/hour. If you expect the class size to be 16, and you expect to do 200 hours of total work (teaching, collecting homework, grading, etc.), then you would set the per-seat fee to $400.
   - question: What is AllCourse’s revenue share?
     answer:
     - While many marketplaces, even in education, charge a 20-30% service fee to pay for all the costs of running the service, AllCourse’s service fee is 15%.
     - Furthermore, teachers who sign up or are referred by an existing AllCourse teacher before December 31st, 2022, will pay an AllCourse service fee of just 12.5% for any course they teach in the 2022-23 school year.
   - question: Are AllCourse teachers eligible for medical benefits?
     answer:
     - No. Teachers don’t work for AllCourse. Teachers on AllCourse are independent contractors.
   - question: What courses can I teach?
     answer:
     - Whatever your heart desires. That said, school administrators are coming to AllCourse to find teachers who are credentialed to teach for-credit courses in their state. If the course needs to be standards-aligned, admins will be specifically looking for that too. While you can offer any course you like, you are most likely to attract buyers if your credentials are clearly listed on your profile and the course is generally acceptable for credit.
   - question: What times should I schedule classes?
     answer:
     - In general, schools prefer to buy courses (even online courses) that are delivered during their school day — especially in core curricula. However, it’s also true that many schools do not mind if their students take online courses that are delivered before or after the school day, or even on evenings and weekends. Our advice is to experiment, and be flexible. Listen to the schools and adjust to their needs. After all, they are the customers.
   - question: Are courses taught live or asynchronously?
     answer:
     - Courses are generally taught live. However, video recordings are something you should create as a matter of course (forgive the pun) as a resource for students who miss live sessions. You choose which video platform you're most comfortable with.
   - question: Do schools have on-ground teachers facilitating these courses? Or am I the only teacher involved?
     answer:
     - It depends. Some schools may have a local teacher in school facilitating a course that you are teaching. They may do this for a variety of reasons. Perhaps they don’t have a teacher who is qualified to teach your particular subject area, but they do have a teacher on the ground who can help guide the students through your material. Or, they may wish to have a proctor available to step into the classroom whenever needed to monitor student behavior.
   - question: What’s to stop admins and teachers from meeting on AllCourse and then transacting offline?
     answer:
     - It is a violation of our Terms of Service. AllCourse’s service fees are modest compared to other marketplaces, and they are necessary in order to keep the platform running and to add new features and improvements. Schools and teachers who meet on AllCourse and then transact offline in order to avoid paying service fees will, at a minimum, be banned from using AllCourse in the future.
   - question: Does AllCourse allow administrators and students to rate or review my classes?
     answer:
     - Yes. We recognize that this is a little different from how things work in a school building, and it may be uncomfortable for some teachers. But this is a different experience for schools as well, and it requires some new approaches. Administrators buying seats on AllCourse don't get to know teachers the way they would by working together in the same school building. So admins need other mechanisms that allow them to trust what they’re getting. Those include clearly listed credentials on your teacher profile page, references from administrators you’ve worked with in the past, and sample videos that showcase your personal style. It also includes teacher ratings and reviews.
     - AllCourse asks all school administrators who’ve purchased seats in your courses, as well as a random sampling of students, to rate the experience and offer reviews. Over time, you will find that one of the best ways build your presence on AllCourse is to make sure your ratings and reviews are healthy. The more you have, the better — when it comes to ratings, buyers trust quantity. And, obviously, try to ensure that they’re positive. Buyers will often search for teachers or courses on the basis of ratings.
   - question: How can I stand out on AllCourse?
     answer:
     - To make your profile and course listings stand out, we highly recommend that you list all credentials, qualifications, and awards. If you want to pursue public school opportunities, you will need to list your teacher license and keep it in good standing. We also recommend you provide references from school administrators you’ve worked with, and sample videos of your teaching style. One of the best ways to build your presence on AllCourse is to keep your ratings and reviews as positive as you can.
   - question: How does the referral bonus work and what are the eligibility requirements?
     answer:
     - For a limited time, earn cash for every other teacher you invite to join the AllCourse community.
     - For every teacher you refer, we’ll give you the first $200 in service fees they generate for AllCourse.
     - Example: You refer a teacher who teaches a course that starts in September 2022. The course generates $5000. The teacher receives $4500, and AllCourse receives $625 (which is our 12.5% service fee). For having referred that teacher, you receive the first $200 of that $625.
     - For a referral to be valid, it must be the first time that person joined AllCourse. Referral bonuses are deducted from AllCourse service fees, which means you will receive bonuses when teachers you refer have taught courses on AllCourse and/or when admins you refer have purchased courses on AllCourse.
     - These referral bonuses are meant to be a big THANK YOU to early adopters for helping spread the word. We’d much rather spend our community marketing dollars on teachers than on Facebook and Google.
 - heading: For School Administrators
   questions:
   - question: How can AllCourse support my school?
     answer:
     - AllCourse makes teacher staffing much easier. You can find a large number of highly qualified, credentialed teachers to teach online courses for your students. They can teach entire courses, or just fill in for a while if a teacher at your school has to take an unexpected leave of absence.
     - AllCourse allows you to offer a much larger course catalog. In addition to core curricula, you can expect to find a great many courses in foreign languages, computer science, special education, arts & music, Advanced Placement, test prep, etc. You might find courses with 8-person max class sizes. You might find girls-only STEM courses. You might find courses taught be teachers at famous schools or even professors from famous colleges.
     - Schools with extra capacity or unusual capabilities can earn income to help fund school operations by sharing those capabilities on AllCourse with other schools that need them.
     - AllCourse works better for everyone when more nearby schools use it. Other schools would love to have online access to your teachers, and you'd benefit from online access to theirs as well. And if you invite other schools and teachers to AllCourse, you can earn valuable credits that your school can apply to future AllCourse purchases.
   - question: What qualifications will my teacher possess?
     answer:
     - Teachers on AllCourse list their qualifications in their teacher profile. They are also strongly encouraged to post sample videos and references. While AllCourse works hard to vet every teacher before they are approved for our platform, we strongly recommend that you vet teachers on your own, watch their videos, and chat with them online before the course begins.
   - question: Do class sessions take place on AllCourse?
     answer:
     - For now, no. Teachers will post class invitations and requirements in their course listings. They will describe which video platform and homework solutions they want to use. If you are working with a teacher to create a custom course listing just for your school, you and the teacher should chat ahead of time to agree on all the particulars. Please communicate any specific expectations you have to the teacher before the course.
     - Over time, we will add capabilities to allow more of the classroom experience to take place on AllCourse for those who would prefer that.
   - question: What happens at the end of the course? Do students receive a grade?
     answer:
     - Yes, AllCourse teachers will assign grades just as they would if they were teaching in your school building.
   - question: How can I negotiate a course time to better fit my school’s student schedules?
     answer:
     - You can contact teachers directly through our chat feature to negotiate times or ask a teacher to add a new section.
   - question: What if I can't find enough teachers from my state on AllCourse?
     answer:
     - AllCourse is a new marketplace. We opened the marketplace in just a few states to begin with. If you can’t find many teachers who are credentialed in your region, it’s probably because we haven’t yet officially launched there and begun recruiting teachers. However, teachers from all over are joining AllCourse every day, even without us actively recruiting them. So please bear with us during these early days, and keep checking back as we grow. You can also email us at customersupport@allcourse.com to tell us of your interest, and we will prioritize your location for teacher recruitment.
   - question: How much does it cost? What payment methods do you accept?
     answer:
     - AllCourse is free to find courses, browse teachers, and post jobs.
     - Once you find a course you want to buy seat(s) in, you purchase seats on the course listing page. How much it costs will depend on how many seats you want to buy, and the teacher's per-seat rate for that course.
     - We accept credit card payments through our website. Or, you can use other payment methods by emailing support@allcourse.com.
   - question: What’s to stop admins and teachers from meeting on AllCourse and then transacting offline, in order to avoid paying AllCourse’s service fee?
     answer:
     - It is a violation of our Terms of Service. AllCourse’s service fees are modest compared to other marketplaces, and they are necessary in order to keep the platform running and to add new features and improvements. Schools and teachers who meet on AllCourse and then transact offline in order to avoid paying service fees will, at a minimum, be banned from using AllCourse in the future.
   - question: What is your refund policy?
     answer:
     - School admins can cancel seats and receive a refund, depending on when they cancel. For most courses, you can cancel and request a refund anytime during the first week of classes. This allows everyone involved to make sure that the fit is right between the student and the class. However, some courses are very short, such as custom courses that teachers offer to a particular school to solve a short-term staffing crisis. If a course is less than 3 weeks long, you can cancel and request a refund anytime prior to the first class session.
     - In the event that a teacher wishes to cancel a course listing, they may do so under the following conditions:
     - * the minimum number of seats have not yet been met; and
     - * the course start date has not passed
     - This allows for teachers to cancel courses that do not meet their profitability threshold, but protects school administrators so that they can rely on seats they pay for being fulfilled. If a teacher cancels a course, 100% of the cost of the seats will be refunded to all purchasers.
   - question: How do referrals work and what are the eligibility requirements?
     answer:
     - For a limited time, school administrators can earn credits by inviting teachers to AllCourse. To avoid any possible conflict of interest, referral bonuses are not paid directly to the referring administrator. Rather, they count as credits that can be deducted against any future AllCourse purchases made by the admin’s school.
     - For every teacher you refer, we’ll give you the first $200 in service fees they generate for AllCourse.
     - For a referral to be valid, it must be the first time that person joined AllCourse. Referral bonuses are deducted from AllCourse service fees, which means you will receive bonuses when teachers you refer have taught courses on AllCourse, and/or when admins you refer have purchased courses on AllCourse.
     - These referral benefits are meant to be a big THANK YOU to early adopters for helping spread the word. We’d much rather spend our marketing dollars on teachers and schools than on Facebook and Google.
     - AllCourse works better for everyone when more nearby schools use it. Other schools would love to have online access to your teachers, and you’d benefit from online access to theirs as well.
 - heading: For Families
   questions:
   - question: Can families buy seats in AllCourse?
     answer:
     - Yes, absolutely. But if you want the course to count for credit in your child’s school, you should get explicit confirmation in advance from the school that they will accept the course for credit.
   - question: Can families pay for courses for our kids if their schools won’t?
     answer:
     - Yes, and this may be something you work out directly with the school administration, whereby you pay for a course but the school still gives it credit.
     - Example: You’re a parent, and your child wants to take an Italian language course through AllCourse. Your child’s school only offers French and Spanish. You ask the principal if they will pay for a seat in the online Italian language course, but the principal declines, saying that they don’t have any extra budget for languages. However, if you’re willing to pay out-of-pocket for the course, you can ask that the school accept the credit for the online Italian course in lieu of an on-ground language course taught in the school.
   - question: Is AllCourse good for home-schoolers?
     answer:
     - Yes. AllCourse provides a huge selection of subjects, class sizes, and teaching styles. And because the courses are taught by licensed teachers and offered in schools for-credit, schools and colleges immediately understand what these courses are about when they see them on your child’s record.
   - question: Why would our family want to use AllCourse?
     answer:
     - Families looking for courses that their schools don’t offer can usually find them listed on AllCourse. That might be AP courses. Or coding, robotics, or AI. It could be courses that are seldom taught now, like civics or home economics. It could be any foreign language on earth. Or different kinds of special education courses. Or any kind of elective you can imagine. Chances are it’s being taught on AllCourse.
     - Home-schoolers may want to use AllCourse both to supplement their curricula and also to increase the transferability and transparency of what their children are learning.
   - question: How do I take a course?
     answer:
     - After you have found a teacher and paid for the course, your teacher will send you details to participate in the online class.
