   questions:
   - question: What is AllCourse and how does it work?
     answer:
     - AllCourse is a marketplace linking schools with credentialed teachers offering for-credit courses. Schools using AllCourse can reduce staffing pressures while significantly increasing their course catalog.
     - Teachers create profiles detailing their professional experience. Teachers can also create listings of courses they’re going to teach.
     - Teacher profiles and courses are easy for school administrators to browse or search. Admins can offer online teaching positions to teachers they connect with. Schools can buy one seat, the entire class, or anything in between. AllCourse manages the matching, the messaging, and the financial transaction.
   - question: Do teachers have to be licensed to teach through AllCourse?
     answer:
     - Not necessarily. Private and charter school teachers often don't have licenses to teach in public schools. AllCourse is open to all qualified teachers, including private and charter school teachers.
     - Teachers who don't provide a license number will not show up in search results for public schools. They may still show up in search results for private or charter schools.
     - Public school teachers should add their license number to their profile, to ensure that they show up in searches for online teaching opportunities with public schools.
   - question: What is the main idea behind AllCourse?
     answer:
     - There is currently a teacher shortage in many parts of the U.S., making it harder to staff schools, which is tough for administrators and bad for students. It also creates additional work and stresses for teachers, who are asked to do ever more.
     - AllCourse makes it much easier to match great teachers with schools. Teachers can earn extra money (they deserve it). And admins can solve their staffing problems and offer students and parents a much larger course catalog.
   - question: Is AllCourse a place for admins to buy individual seats in online courses, or a place to hire teachers who will teach online classes just for their school?
     answer:
     - Schools can do either or both.
     - If admins need someone to teach an entire section, they can search profiles for a teacher who best meets their particular needs and work with that teacher to schedule a course specifically for their school. The teacher will create a customized course listing and the admin will buy all of the seats.
     - In many cases, schools won’t require every seat in a particular course. But they might want to buy a few seats in order to satisfy interested students and parents. Using AllCourse, schools can offer online courses in just about every subject, or with a particular pedagogical focus such as micro class size or remedial/advanced material. When buying just a small number of seats in a course, there will likely be students from other schools participating.
