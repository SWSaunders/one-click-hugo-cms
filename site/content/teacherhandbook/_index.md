   - point: First steps in creating your course
     text:
     - 1. Start by creating a basic outline.
     - 2. Create a detailed lesson plan.
     - >
      3. Decide if you want to have a distinctive pedagogical approach. For instance:
     - >
      <ul>
      <li>You could limit class size to a very small number of students, so as to position the course for students who will benefit from a lot of personal attention in that subject</li>
      <li>You could offer a girls-only STEM class under the theory that girls tend to speak up less in STEM classes when boys are present</li>
      <li>You could try a partially or fully flipped classroom in which students spend some or all of their homework hours watching video lessons to learn the underlying concepts and then work problems together with you in class. Video lessons could be curated from YouTube or other sites, or could be your own prerecorded videos, or a combination of both.</li>
      </ul>
     - 4. Create a syllabus and a homework plan.
   - point: Listing your course
     text:
     - >
      Once you decide exactly what you want your course to be, find a way to communicate in your course listing so that people can very quickly visualize what your course will be like. Course listings should clearly explain several things:
     - >
      <ul>
      <li>what the course is all about and how it will proceed week to week</li>
      <li>the overarching course goals: what students will have accomplished by successfully completing the course</li>
      <li>your teaching experience and style</li>
      <li>where you’re licensed and your course is aligned to particular standards</li>
      </ul>
     - Decide on the schedule you want to offer. This will have a lot to do with where you’re licensed, and whether or not you have a full-time day job (especially if that day job is as a teacher in a school).
