    You want to work with a team of people who get it. They've been around the block and they're still excited about
    making things. You communicate really well, and value others who do the same. You reflect and learn from your
    successes, and failures -- and you’ve had the opportunity to learn a lot. You want to work somewhere that
    minimizes process, so everyone is free to spend their time on the good stuff. You can’t believe hierarchical
    management is still even a thing. You have strong opinions but hold them lightly. You recognize there are a bunch
    of ways to do something well. You want to be a whole person at work. You want time and flexibility to be you: to
    go on a walk, take care of your child, go to the doctor, and feel supported by your coworkers. And you want to
    support them so that they can live good lives too.
